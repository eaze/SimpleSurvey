# Eaze Services Homework Assignment - Simple Survey
Create a simple anonymous survey. <br/>

Build an API in Node.js or .NET Core to allow for the anonymous creation/taking of surveys (i.e. you don't have to create a user account to create a survey).

## Specifications:
API Should Support:
Creating a survey
Taking a Survey
Getting Results of a Survey
A survey should consist of survey questions and each question should have yes/no (true/false) answers

Data Persistence:
You will need to persist the data in some way. You DO NOT need to use a database, and the easier for us to run it the better :).  But think about how you would want to do it in production and write up (one paragraph) how you would do it. 

Use whatever framework or libraries you like. Please include a README with instructions on how to run it. Finally, have fun!
